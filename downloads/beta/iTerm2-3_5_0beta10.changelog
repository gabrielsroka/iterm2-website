3.5.0beta10

New Features:
- Add support for inline SVGs.
- Mouse reporting now supports horizontal
  scrolling and more mouse buttons.
- Add "Duplicate Session". It supports ssh
  integration, even with jump hosts!
- Add "Add Alert on Marks in Offscreen Sessions"
  which is a sticky setting that lets you know
  when a command in a not-currently-visible
  session finishes. Requires shell integration.

Other Improvements:
- The artificial intelligence feature defaults to
  GPT-3 rather than codex. While it isn't free, it
  works much better. Use the advanced setting
  "OpenAI Model name" to adjust the model.
- Changes to dynamic profiles are now detected
  more quickly.
- Fix UI glitch in background image blending
  controls.
- Upgrade libssh2 to 1.10.
- Double-tap modifier hotkeys now activate on key
  up rather than key down to avoid false
  activations.
- When using ssh integration, file transfers no
  longer require a new connection. They share the
  existing channel.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a bug where images disappear prematurely.
- Remap modifiers on mouse clicks like we do for
  keypresses.
- Fix cursor color in reverse video mode. It
  should also be reversed.
- Fix ssh integration on systems whose /bin/sh is
  POSIX but not Bash.
