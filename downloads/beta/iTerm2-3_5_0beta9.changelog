3.5.0beta9

This version of iTerm2 requires macOS 10.15.
Support for 10.14 had to be dropped.

New Features:
- Add AI-powered natural language command
  generation. Enter a prompt in the composer and
  select Edit > Engage Artificial Intelligence.
  You will need to provide an OpenAI API key since
  GPT costs money to use.
- Add Window > Move session to tab
- Key bindings can now be applied to multiple
  sessions (e.g., all sessions in this window)..
- You can now customize copy mode shortcuts by
  placing a file in ~/Library/Application
  Support/iTerm2/CopyModeKeyBindings.dict.
  See the simliarly named file in the app bundle
  for a reference.
- Add menu item to clear instant replay.
- Add ability for composer to enqueue a command.
- ssh integration is now easily usable from the
  command line. Use it2ssh instead of ssh.

Other Improvements:
- Use XDG_CONFIG_HOME for .iterm2 folder when set.
- When the country+language do not match a valid
  POSIX locale, present a UI to select one.
- There's a new key binding action to alert on the
  next mark.
- Emoji flags now draw as double-width.
- Don't sync the most recent coprocess commands
  with remote prefs.
- Make certain powerline symbols draw wider.

  mode.

  tab/window titles.
- Add 'interpret key bindings based on physical
  key, ignoring input language' setting.
- Add missing powerline extra symbols.
- Restore terminal state when an ssh session ends
  when using it2ssh.
- Make the tmux-256color terminfo available by
  default. Improves various problems in tmux
  integration such as function keys sending the
  wrong codes.
- Add option to notify of noncritical shell
  integration updates.
