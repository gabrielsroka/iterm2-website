2022-08-22: Fix window resize loop where a non-tmux tab
would cause the window to grow when we get a layout change,
causing us to tell tmux the window grew, and so on forever.
Issue 10249

2022-08-17: Allow link drag operations to paste the
filename. Issue 10538

2022-08-17: Ensure status bar components in the stable
layout algorithm are never smaller than their minimum size.
Because the desired size is initialized to 0, the code that
uses apportionment to ensure width distribution makes
progress could inadvertantly create too-small components.
This can happen when there's a flexible spacer with a high
spring constant as seen in issue 10533

2022-08-13: Don't set the dirty flag when scrolling the
screen up. VT100Grid already tracks whether it has scrolled
via  and we can use that instead. This changed with the
great multithreading of '22 - I modified it to set all lines
dirty when scrolling so they'd be synced, but that isn't
actually necessary. Doing so introduced a bug (issue 10524)
because the dirty flag has a second purpose of tracking
which search results should be erased on a line-by-line
basis.

style changes don't adjust window's frame if it exactly
touches the right edge.

target and the file provider target. I don't think this will
break app building for third parties since they have to
modifiy code signing settings anyway. This is necessary to
make the file provider stuff work.

2022-07-15: Fix a bug where compact opaque windows with
image backgrounds and 1 tab and no tabbar showed the image
under the titlebar. It was wrong to assume that opaque
windows have a window background behind the fake titlebar,
since that is not true when there's an image background.

case where there's more than one field with label
"password"; always choose the first field with `id` set to
`"password"` instead of asking `op` to give us the one with
that label since it can return the wrong one. #475
