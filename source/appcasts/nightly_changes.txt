numberOfWrappedLinesWithWidth:upToAbsoluteBlockNumber:]

ConnectionRefused. Issue 9258

2022-09-24: Remove another source of accidentally quadratic
behavior in graph db: transactions. They make a copy of the
array for each child. Since the array is append only we can
rollback by truncating the array. Issue 10572

2022-09-24: Try to handle handoff (remote clipboard)
correctly. I can't find any official docs on how to do this
- they probably assume pasting files pastes their content?
So I'll com.apple.is-remote-clipboard to tell if it smells
like a URL whose content should be pasted. Also it only
seems to have attributed strings and plaintext is just
pasted directly. Issue 10579

confirmation. Issue 5009

etc.) and offer to turn off focus reporting. Issue 10351

not quite sure how this ever worked before.

copy-with-control-sequences for bright ANSI colors. Issue
10568

2022-09-08: Fix the priority inversion by using synchronous
dispatch from main queue to token executor. This has a
pretty good chance of being correct. See previous commit for
more details and helpless flailing

2022-09-08: Attempt to fix a priority inversion error. I
really don't know if I succeeded, and I think I probably
didn't. We'll see if tsan complains again. If it does read
these tea leaves:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-performance-issues-early?language=objc

repeatedly overwritten

PTYScrollView when creating a split pane. Issue 10561
