etc.) and offer to turn off focus reporting. Issue 10351

2022-09-12: Hack updateVersion to use homebrew python3. I'm

dispatch from main queue to token executor. This has a
pretty good chance of being correct. See previous commit for
more details and helpless flailing

2022-09-08: Attempt to fix a priority inversion error. I
really don't know if I succeeded, and I think I probably
didn't. We'll see if tsan complains again. If it does read
these tea leaves:

2022-09-04: Try to release images that are overwritten. This
is definitely imperfect but it's an improvement over the
status quo, especially for issue 10565 where an image is
repeatedly overwritten

PTYScrollView when creating a split pane. Issue 10561

10536

2022-08-29: Fix SGR0 when using 'Copy with Control
Sequences' (#478)

I found that when I use **Edit -> Copy with Control
Sequences** on `Build 3.5.20220828-nightly`, the resulting
copied text has `\x1b[0` *without* a trailing `m` before
newlines and at the end of the text.

I could definitely be confused here (ECMA-48 is a bit dense
haha), but it *seemed* like the SGR sequences are required
to end in the character `m` (aka `\x6d` aka 06/13).
Specifically it says

> **8.3.117 SGR - SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION** > Notation:
(Ps...) > Representation: CSI Ps... 06/13 > Parameter
default value: Ps = 0

If this is intentional (aka, there's some part of the spec
I'm missing, which is more than likely) then we can just
close this out.

Note: I had trouble getting this to build locally (kept
failing with `No account for team "H7V7XYVQ7D"` despite
changing it to `Sign to Run Locally`), but I can try again
if you'd like me to specifically verify the change locally.

super slow for some users. Issue 10505

2022-08-22: Fix window resize loop where a non-tmux tab
would cause the window to grow when we get a layout change,
causing us to tell tmux the window grew, and so on forever.
Issue 10249

2022-08-17: Allow link drag operations to paste the
filename. Issue 10538

2022-08-17: Ensure status bar components in the stable
layout algorithm are never smaller than their minimum size.
Because the desired size is initialized to 0, the code that
uses apportionment to ensure width distribution makes
progress could inadvertantly create too-small components.
This can happen when there's a flexible spacer with a high
spring constant as seen in issue 10533

2022-08-13: Don't set the dirty flag when scrolling the
screen up. VT100Grid already tracks whether it has scrolled
via  and we can use that instead. This changed with the
great multithreading of '22 - I modified it to set all lines
dirty when scrolling so they'd be synced, but that isn't
actually necessary. Doing so introduced a bug (issue 10524)
because the dirty flag has a second purpose of tracking
which search results should be erased on a line-by-line
basis.
