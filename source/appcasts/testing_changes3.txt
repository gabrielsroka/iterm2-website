3.5.0beta6

New features
- Add "Render Selection", which replaces a chunk
  of selected text with a natively rendered view.
  For example, JSON gets pretty-printed and syntax
  highlighted. Rendered selections have the option
  of scrolling horizontally to make navigating
  logs easier. They are searchable. Over 150
  different languages are supported for syntax
  highlighting. Markdown gets special treatment
  and displays its rendered format.
- Enable logging as asciicast, which is playable
  by asciinema.
- Add option not to require a password to open the
  password manager.
- (Experimental) The password manager can now use
  LastPass or 1Password rather than the keychain.
  Use the (â‹¯) menu next to the search field to
  configure it.
- You can configure a shortcut to be a "leader".
  This allows you to define two-keystroke
  shortcuts, composed of leader + some other
  shortcut. For example, if you make cmd-B the
  leader then you can create a key binding for
  leader+h/j/k/l to navigate among split panes.
  In tmux integration, key bindings are
  automatically created to emulate tmux's
  shortcuts with the leader in place of tmux's
  prefix key.
  You can set up the leader in Prefs > Keys >
  Leader.
- The composer now supports search.
- The composer (cmd-shift-.) now supports multiple
  cursors. Use ctrl-shift-up/down or option-drag to
  create them. You can also convert search results
  to cursors with Edit > Find > Select Matches.
- You can resize the composer's height by dragging
  its bottom edge.
- Cmd-click in the composer opens the command in
  explainshell.com.
- In the composer, option-shift-enter sends the
  command at the cursor and removes it from the
  composer.
- Add "copy" as a new smart selection action.
- Option-cmd-click now selects the second smart
  selection action.
- Add a new kind of key binding action called
  "sequence" that performs any number of other key
  binding actions in order.
- Shell integration can now be injected
  automatically as part of creating a login shell.
  Explicit installation is no longer needed on
  localhost (except for tcsh users, who are still
  stuck in 1995. Sorry).
- Selecting URLs (cmd-opt-u) now enables shortcuts
  to jump to them by number.

  sessions have are also now provided to
  coprocesses.

  These are sometimes used in nerd fonts.
