3.5.0beta7

New features
- There is a nascent SSH integration feature
  available for testing. Warning: it definitely
  has a lot of bugs. You can try it by setting the
  profile's command to SSH. The integration lets
  you export environment variables and copy files
  to the remote host. If Python 3.7 or later is
  available on the remote host, various features
  such as the Jobs status bar and toolbar
  components will reflect data from the remote
  rather than the local. There's also a
  barely-working feature that automatically mounts
  the remote host's filesystem as a cloud
  filesystem.
- There's a new control sequence for rich
  notifications:
[esc]1337;Notification=[params][control-G]
  Where params is a semicolon-delimited list of
  key value pairs:
  message=[text]
    The text to display.
  title=[text]
    Optional notification title.
  subtitle=[text]
    Optional notification subtitle.
  image=[data]
    Optional base64-encoded image.
- You can now remap the fn key if you have a
  MacBook.

  nightly build users.

Other improvements
- There are new key binding actions for Windows
  refugees who want to use Control-C and Control-V
  to copy and paste. "Copy or Send ^C" and "Paste
  or Send ^V" will copy (if there's a selection)
  or paste (if the clibpoard has text)
  and otherwise send the control character.

  downloading.

  dark mode.

  alternate screen mode.

  overwritten.
